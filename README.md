# Blackjack 
----
Blackjack is a card game with the aim of getting to the number 21 which is Blackjack.

There are four suits of cards in the game when playing with a normal deck. Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts and Spades.
The Ace in each suit can either be valued at 11 or 1. This is where the trick come in. 

In this card game there is one player who is playing against the dealer. The aim is to get to 21 before the dealer.

The dealer deals cards in their suits and values. The player can choose to either 'Hit' or 'Stand' hit means they request another card to move get closer to the total. Stand means they feel they are too close to the total and will not take a card this round. 
There is risk either way in the choice. That is the game. 

Here is the live version of my project:

## How to Play
----

When playing the Game follow the prompts of the messages in the console.
Choose either "Hit" or "Stand" to get the closest to 21. The aim is 21 but the closest wins.
If you get 21 you have scored Blackjack and will win. 


## Features
----


## Testing
----
All testing was done by myself and my sons on game play. 



## Bugs
----

Although there are no functional bugs that could be found. ( I used my sons as bug testers and asked them to break the game.) There are syntax errors in the code which I was still working on a the time of submission.

While the syntax spacing is not 100% the application does run and work. 

## Deployment
______
This project has been deployed from Git Hub to Heroku at the link above. 



## Credits
______

All credit goes to Beau Carnes of Free Code Camp. I followed the Blackjack game tutorial online.
I looked at a number of other games. This one produced a simple result.
